# E-Commerce Store via Redux

## Description

This e-commerce store was refactored from using a Context API to using Redux to manage global state with React. The user can register via a Signup/Login page, browse various categories, save and remove products to their Cart, view details about the products, and checkout with the implementation of Stripe.
